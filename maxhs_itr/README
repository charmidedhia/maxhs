MaxHS a fast and robust MaxSat solver.

MaxHS exploits a hybrid approach between SAT and MIPS. The code uses
minisat v2.2 (http://minisat.se/) as the SAT solver and IBM's CPLEX as
the MIPS solver.

MaxHS is developed by Jessica Davies and Fahiem Bacchus

Building and installing:
-----------------------
0) Get CPLEX. 
-------------

   The code must be linked against the libraries of the CPLEX system
   from IBM. For faculty and graduate students in academia CPLEX is
   available at no cost under IBM's academic initiative program:

   http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/university/academic/pub/page/ban_ilog_programming

   If that link does not function a google search on "IBM Academic
   Initiative CPLEX" should be able to find the right site.

   You must apply to IBM for their academic initiative program. It
   takes a few days for them to process your application after which
   you can access and download CPLEX and other IBM software.

   CPLEX can also be obtained under various commercial licenses.

1) Configure
------------
Use "make config VAR=defn" or edit config.mk directly to set the
following make file variables.

Required variable settings:
===========================

CPLEXLIBDIR=<path to CPLEX library>
   #directory that contains libcplex.a for your machine architecture

CPLEXINCDIR=<path to CPLEX headers>
   #top level include directory. cplex.h should be a file in
   #one of the subdirectories (probably in "include/ilcplex")

Required if you want to install:
================================

MaxHS will be built into the "build/[release|debug|profile]/bin"
sub-directory. The executable is by default statically linked. A linkable
library is also constructed in "build/[release|debug|profile]/lib.

If instead you want to install these final build products in a more
globally acccessible location you will need to set the following
variable:

prefix=<location for install; default = '/usr/local'>

And then execute 

make install

  #"make install" puts the MaxHS executable in $(prefix)/bin, the
  #MaxHS library in $(prefix)/lib and the MaxHS include headers in
  #$(prefix)/include

  (will only be able to install into directories that you have
  write permission on.)
  
Optional variable settings:
==========================
Various compiler settings can be configured, see the Makefile

Notes:

- The MaxHS make file is a modification of the minisat make file.

- Multiple configuration steps can be joined into one call to "make
  config" by appending multiple variable assignments on the same line.

- The configuration is stored in the file "config.mk". Look here if
  you want to know what the current configuration looks like.

- To reset from defaults simply delete the "config.mk" file or call
  "make distclean".

- Once configured, recompilation can be done as many times as wanted. 

2) Compile and Build 
-----------

make         --- build a statically linked release version
make p       --- build a statically linked profiling version
make install --- build a static release version then install
